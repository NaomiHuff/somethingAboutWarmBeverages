Good Morning!

My Name is Naomi Huff. I am 24 years old and I currently live in Reno, NV. I am a full time Respiratory Therapist at a local hospital. I love being able to help people get better and breathe easier. I work in adult and pediatric areas, but my passion is working with the kiddos. It is so fun to see them get better from crazy health issues. They are pretty stinking inspiring! 

I am married to a software engineer named Sam. We just celebrated our one year anniversary! He is pretty great. He is the one that suggested that I started this blog. Since graduating college in 2016 I have been trying to find some constructive hobbies to have. I have a lot of words to say and I love trying new coffee shops so he suggested that I start a blog reviewing coffee shops in my area.  While that was the original plan for this blog, he and I have started a new "health" journey. 

I have always struggled with my weight  and feeling comfortable and healthy. We both have noticed that since we got married we have fallen out of some of our healthy habits. We have been not careful with what we eat. Anyhow... We decided to do a September Whole 30! So far it has been a success? kinda? We have made super delicious meals. I have been really careful about portion sizes and not snacking. I LOVE snacks, so that part has been my biggest struggle so far. (not saying much since we have only done 2 days.) So far the bigest discouragement has been that yesterday I got very bloaty. I mean I looked like I was 5 months pregnant and I am not pregnant at all. 

Today is a new day (I'm back to my normal bloat levels). I'm going to start the day off with a hot cup of coffee and enjoy having my hubby off of work for an extra day! 

PS a HUGE shoutout to TheDefinedDish and PrimalGourmet for basically all of the recipes that I have used so far.
